200 -> Means everything is successful.
201 -> means successful but it also means something was created on the server.
300 (range) => redirect.
400 (range) => user error like lets say you forgot an email in your form and email is required
it would give you a 400 back.
500(range) => server error so if something happens on the server side then you get the 500 
range.
